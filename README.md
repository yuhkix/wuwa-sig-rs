A high-performance, thread-safe Rust library for memory scanning and hooking Windows applications, specifically designed for bypassing PAK file verification in WuWa (Wuthering Waves).

## üöÄ Features

- **High-Performance Memory Scanning**: Optimized pattern matching algorithms with caching
- **Thread-Safe Hook Management**: State tracking and safe hook application/removal
- **Structured Logging**: Configurable log levels with colored output and timestamps
- **Safe Memory Access**: Bounds checking and error handling for all unsafe operations
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal allocations, efficient algorithms, and caching
- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for easy maintenance
- **Comprehensive Documentation**: Detailed API documentation and examples

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

The library is organized into several focused modules:

- **`config`**: Configuration management with validation and defaults
- **`constants`**: Application constants and magic numbers
- **`error`**: Comprehensive error handling with thiserror integration
- **`hooks`**: Thread-safe hook management with state tracking
- **`logger`**: High-performance structured logging system
- **`memory`**: Optimized memory scanning and pattern matching
- **`safety`**: Safe abstractions for unsafe operations

## üì¶ Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Windows 10/11** (x64)
- **Rust 1.75+** with Cargo
- **Visual Studio Build Tools** (for Windows API bindings)
- **Administrator privileges** (for DLL injection operations)

### Building

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yuhkix/wuwa-sig-rs.git
cd wuwa-sig-rs

# Build in debug mode
cargo build

# Build in release mode
cargo build --release
```

The compiled DLL will be available at `target/release/wuwa_sig_rs.dll`.

## üõ°Ô∏è Safety

This library uses unsafe code for low-level memory operations and Windows API calls. All unsafe operations are wrapped in safe abstractions with:

- **Bounds checking** for memory access
- **Null pointer validation** before dereferencing
- **Panic recovery** for critical operations
- **Comprehensive error handling** with detailed error messages

## ‚ö° Performance

The library is optimized for performance with:

- **Cached module scanning** to avoid repeated system calls
- **Optimized pattern matching** with different algorithms for different pattern types
- **Efficient memory access patterns** with minimal copying
- **Thread-safe operations** without unnecessary locking
- **Minimal allocations** in hot paths

## üß™ Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test module
cargo test memory::tests
```

## üîí Security & Legal Considerations

- **Educational Purpose**: This software is provided for legitimate game modification research
- **Game Terms**: Users must comply with Wuthering Waves Terms of Service
- **Administrator Access**: DLL injection requires elevated privileges
- **Process Isolation**: Always ensure proper game process boundaries
- **Responsible Use**: Intended for development and research purposes only
